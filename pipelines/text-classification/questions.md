# Text Classification Pipeline Questions

## Question 1: exercise_1
**Title:** Grammar Checking with Text Classification

**Description:** Text classification can be used for various tasks including grammatical error detection. This involves using pre-trained models to identify whether a sentence contains grammatical errors.

**Question:** When using the text-classification pipeline for grammar checking, which of the following is the correct way to create a grammar checker pipeline?

**Options:**
- `pipeline(task="grammar-check", model="abdulmatinomotoso/English_Grammar_Checker")`
- `pipeline(task="text-classification", model="abdulmatinomotoso/English_Grammar_Checker")`
- `pipeline(task="text-generation", model="abdulmatinomotoso/English_Grammar_Checker")`
- `pipeline(task="sentiment-analysis", model="abdulmatinomotoso/English_Grammar_Checker")`

**Correct Answer:** `pipeline(task="text-classification", model="abdulmatinomotoso/English_Grammar_Checker")`

**Explanation:** Grammar checking is a specific application of text classification where the model classifies text as grammatically correct or incorrect. The task parameter should be "text-classification" with the appropriate grammar checking model.

## Question 2: exercise_2
**Title:** Question Natural Language Inference (QNLI)

**Description:** QNLI is a text classification task that determines whether a given premise contains enough information to answer a posed question.

**Question:** What does QNLI (Question Natural Language Inference) specifically evaluate?

**Options:**
- Whether a question is grammatically correct
- Whether a premise contains sufficient information to answer a question
- Whether two sentences have the same meaning
- Whether a text is positive or negative in sentiment

**Correct Answer:** Whether a premise contains sufficient information to answer a question

**Explanation:** QNLI evaluates whether a given premise/text contains enough information to answer a posed question. It determines if the answer can be found in the provided text, making it useful for reading comprehension and information retrieval tasks.

## Question 3: exercise_3
**Title:** Zero-Shot Classification

**Description:** Zero-shot classification allows models to classify text into predefined categories without prior training on those specific categories.

**Question:** In zero-shot classification, what is required to classify text into categories that the model hasn't been specifically trained on?

**Options:**
- Fine-tuning the model on the target categories
- Providing the text and a list of predefined category labels
- Training a new model from scratch
- Using only the original training data

**Correct Answer:** Providing the text and a list of predefined category labels

**Explanation:** Zero-shot classification works by providing the input text along with a list of candidate labels/categories. The model can then classify the text into one of these categories without needing specific training on those categories, using its general language understanding.

## Question 4: exercise_4
**Title:** Text Classification Pipeline Tasks

**Description:** The text-classification pipeline in Hugging Face can handle various tasks by using different pre-trained models optimized for specific classification objectives.

**Question:** Which of the following is NOT typically considered a text classification task?

**Options:**
- Sentiment analysis (positive/negative)
- Spam detection (spam/not spam)
- Grammatical error detection
- Text summarization

**Correct Answer:** Text summarization

**Explanation:** Text summarization is a text generation task, not a classification task. It involves creating a shorter version of the input text rather than assigning it to predefined categories. Text classification tasks involve categorizing input text into discrete labels or classes.

## Question 5: exercise_5
**Title:** Model Selection for Specific Tasks

**Description:** Different text classification models are optimized for different tasks. Choosing the right model is crucial for achieving good performance on specific classification objectives.

**Question:** When performing QNLI (Question Natural Language Inference), which type of model architecture is most commonly used?

**Options:**
- Generative models like GPT
- Cross-encoder models like "cross-encoder/qnli-electra-base"
- Image classification models
- Speech recognition models

**Correct Answer:** Cross-encoder models like "cross-encoder/qnli-electra-base"

**Explanation:** Cross-encoder models are specifically designed for tasks that require understanding the relationship between two pieces of text (question and premise). They process both inputs simultaneously, making them ideal for QNLI tasks where the model needs to determine if a premise answers a question.

## Question 6: exercise_6
**Title:** Pipeline Output Format

**Description:** Text classification pipelines return structured outputs containing labels and confidence scores, which help in understanding the model's predictions.

**Question:** In zero-shot classification, what information is typically included in the pipeline output?

**Options:**
- Only the predicted label
- Only the confidence score
- Both labels ranked by confidence and their corresponding scores
- The original input text only

**Correct Answer:** Both labels ranked by confidence and their corresponding scores

**Explanation:** Zero-shot classification outputs typically include a list of labels ranked by confidence scores and their corresponding probability scores. This allows users to see not just the top prediction but also alternative classifications and their confidence levels.

## Question 7: exercise_7
**Title:** Dynamic Category Assignment

**Description:** Dynamic category assignment in zero-shot classification enables flexible text categorization without retraining models for new categories.

**Question:** What is the main advantage of dynamic category assignment in zero-shot classification?

**Options:**
- It requires less computational resources
- It can classify text into new categories without model retraining
- It always provides 100% accurate results
- It only works with pre-defined categories

**Correct Answer:** It can classify text into new categories without model retraining

**Explanation:** The main advantage of dynamic category assignment is flexibility - you can define new categories on-the-fly without needing to retrain or fine-tune the model. This makes it extremely useful for applications where categories might change frequently or when you need to experiment with different classification schemes.

## Question 8: exercise_8
**Title:** Text Classification Applications

**Description:** Text classification has numerous real-world applications across different domains, from content moderation to information organization.

**Question:** Which of the following scenarios would benefit most from using a text classification pipeline?

**Options:**
- Generating creative stories
- Automatically categorizing customer support tickets
- Translating text between languages
- Converting speech to text

**Correct Answer:** Automatically categorizing customer support tickets

**Explanation:** Automatically categorizing customer support tickets is a perfect text classification use case. It involves taking input text (the support ticket) and assigning it to predefined categories (like "billing", "technical", "general inquiry"), which helps route tickets to appropriate departments and prioritize responses.
